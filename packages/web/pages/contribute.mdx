import { Box } from "theme-ui";

1. Open the Dai UI [sandbox] and create your recipe using the component library.
2. Create a new file in our [github repo] and add the template below.
3. Copy your recipe from the sandbox into the template and submit a pull request.

<Box p={3}>

```js
const title = "My Recipe";
const description = "Add a detailed description.";
const playroomHash = "#?code="; // Add the entire query string from the URL.

// Be sure to wrap your recipe in backticks like the example.
const component = `
<MyComponent />
`;

export default {
  component,
  title,
  description,
  playroomHash,
};
```

</Box>
